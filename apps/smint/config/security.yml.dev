# for development: download is NOT secure!

# currently available credentials

# - access (login) - automatically assigned to all users so no explicit action is defined
# - writeAnnotations (allows you also to read your own annotations)
# - readAnnotations (allows you to read all annotations)
# - viewFeatures (also applies to Tags, or future feature types)
# - executeSQL (some features may depend on this action - like the statistic page)
# - playAudio (access mp3 files)
# - admin (enables all other and some additional actions)
 
# all these access rights depend on actions that do not hide any gui
# component, but check the user's access approvals before executing the
# actions. if a related gui component is shown and activated by the user the
# user will be informed that he has no right to perform the action.
