	</li>
<br/>	
	<li><b>Cookies.</b> Spectralmind uses a technology called “cookies” as part of its normal business procedure to enhance the user experience and to track patterns of behaviour of visitors to the Service.
A cookie is an element of data that a website sends to your browser that is then stored on your system. You can set your browser to prevent this happening. Any information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you change your browser settings.
<br/>
Furthermore, Spectralmind may use third party vendors like Google to analyze the usage of the Spectralmind Service. These third parties collect information, including but not limited to the placement of cookies,  about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor.  All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.
By using the Service, you agree that Spectralmind or third parties used by Spectralmind can place these types of cookies on your device.
	</li>
<br/>	
	<li><b>Responsibility of Users.</b> You can only post content to the Service for the sake of triggering a search process. All content, that you post, resides only temporarily on the Service and cannot be  redownloaded in any way. However, if you post content to the Service, or otherwise make (or allow any third party) to post content to the Service, you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software.

		<li>the Content is not pornographic, libelous or defamatory, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party.</li>

	<br/>
	By submitting Content to Spectralmind, you grant Spectralmind a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to process, reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of  the service.
Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Spectralmind has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Spectralmind's sole discretion (i) refuse, reject or remove any content that, in Spectralmind's reasonable opinion, violates any Spectralmind terms and policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Service to any individual or entity for any reason, in Spectralmind's sole discretion.
